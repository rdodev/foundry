# Foundry [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rdodev/foundry.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/rdodev/foundry)
### A Rackspace-Flavored OpenStackâ„¢ Heat Web-Based Template Builder
---

## Intro:
A small web app that was born out of both, necessity and an "out-of-the-box" project idea. The intent is to provide a visual, constrained, scoped guide to learn and use Rackspace Orchestration to deploy infrastructure in a repeatable, deterministic manner with virtually zero setup beyond a web browser and a Rackspace account.

## To Use Locally:
1. Clone this repository
2. `cd` into the directory it was cloned into
3. Either `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` or `python3 -m http.server`
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
5. Profit!

## To Use On The Web:
The app can be seen and used here [https://heat.foundry.rocks](https://heat.foundry.rocks)

## To Develop:
1. Clone this repository
2. `cd` into the directory it was cloned into
3. run `npm install`
4. run `npm install -g karma-cli`
5. If you want coverage testing (and trust me, you do): `npm install istanbul karma-coverage --save-dev`
6. Code away!
7. run `karma start test.local.conf.js`

Entry point is app.js which is located in `app` directory. From here it should be obvious that all html markup goes in the `views` folder and the controller and business logic in `controllers`. If adding new controller or view, please follow the nomenclature convention already in place.
